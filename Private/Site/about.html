                Hello, I'm Xoorath here on the internet and Jared in the fleshiverse. I'm a Canadian video game developer currently based out of

            <h2>The good life</h2>
            <p>
                On my own time I've settled on a fairly consistent approach to problem solving, learning and helping others.
                My focus is often on building tools for myself to use or learn while developing. Sometimes I like to make games outside of work too.
                My favorite kinds of games are factory and survival games like Factorio and Satisfactory.
            </p>
            
            <h2>The work life</h2>
            <p>
                In 2008 I chose to make a career out of programming and making video games. Over the past 15+ years I've been learning, programming, leading and sometimes organizing events.
                Most of my time has been spent as a game engine programmer (or adjacent), with about half of my time so far in a lead or director position.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fellow game developers often ask if I like programming or management more. I honestly don't know. I just like working with nice people, really.
            </p>
            <h2>These days</h2>
            <p>
                I'm spending my time with my wife and our chickens, occasionally tinkering on projects like this website or other small coding curiosities and not as much on large side projects as I used to.
                At the time of writing I'm playing through Cyberpunk Phantom Liberty and thinking of building an indie game.
