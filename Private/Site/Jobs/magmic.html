            <p>
                I worked as a gameplay programmer at Magmic for just over a year. Magmic is a small game studio in Ottawa that 
                (at the time) specialized in mobile casino games, blackberry themes and licensed apps.
            </p>
            <p>
                While working there I shipped Texas Hold 'Em King Live on Blackberry 10, contributed to New York Times Crosswords updates,
                and worked briefly on Skip Bo and Slots King when they were early in development.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this role I learned about multi platform development and gameplay programming as a part of a professional team. 
                I was able to teach members of the team about C++, the QNX generation of Blackberries and a bit about graphics programming.
