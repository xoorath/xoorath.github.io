            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>
                Hello, I'm Xoorath here on the internet and Jared in the fleshiverse. I'm a Canadian video game developer currently based out of
                <a class="out" href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=redmond+washington&ia=web&iaxm=maps">Redmond WA</a> since 2019.
            </p>

            <h2>The good life</h2>
            <p>
                On my own time I've settled on a fairly consistent approach to problem solving, learning and helping others.
                My focus is often on building tools for myself to use or learn while developing. Sometimes I like to make games outside of work too.
                I enjoy playing games like Arma 3 with my friends and trying out whatever's new on Game Pass. My favorite kinds of games are factory and survival games like Factorio and Satisfactory.
            </p>
            
            <h2>The work life</h2>
            <p>
                In 2008 I chose to make a career out of programming and making video games. Over the past 11+ years I've been programming, leading and sometimes organizing events. 
                Most of my time has been spent as a game engine programmer (or adjacent), with ~5 years in a lead or director position.
            </p>
            <h2>These days</h2>
            <p>
                I'm focused on taking on and finishing smaller projects like <a class="out" href="github.com/xoorath/esd">Electrostatic Discharge</a> and <a class="out" href="github.com/xoorath/esd">xo-math</a>.
