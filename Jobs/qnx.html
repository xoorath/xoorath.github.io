            <p>
                At QNX I worked as a programmer on the graphics team where I worked to optimize the BlackBerry home screen for both the
                <a class="out" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackBerry_PlayBook">Playbook</a> and <a class="out" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackBerry_Z10">Z10</a> 
                as well as working on some home screen features such as folders, effects and the status bar.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was on this team that I learned to work in C, on embedded systems and with OpenGL:ES.
