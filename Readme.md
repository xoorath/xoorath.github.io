# Electrostatic Discharge Quick Start

This project is here to help you get started with [Electrostatic Discharge](https://github.com/xoorath/esd) [version 0.2](https://github.com/xoorath/esd/releases/tag/v0.2).

* ESD is incredibly lightweight, all platform binaries are less than 1mb combined.
* ESD is incredibly fast, building your static website faster than you can ctrl+shift+b.
* ESD is feature poor by design. It provides [include file support and variables](https://github.com/xoorath/esd/blob/main/Docs/Example.md). The rest is up to you.

Take a minute to get aquanted with the template and give it a build with `Build.bat / Build.sh` or the build task in vscode.
